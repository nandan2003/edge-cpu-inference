# CPU Inference Benchmark Suite

A Multi-Dimensional Evaluation of 8 Large Language Models on Commodity Cloud CPUs

---

## Overview

This repository provides a complete, reproducible evaluation of eight state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) under **CPU-only** conditions. The objective is to determine which architectures offer the most favorable balance between:

* computational cost
* reasoning accuracy
* coding correctness
* RAM requirements
* real-time throughput
* general robustness under quantization

The entire benchmark stack is implemented in Python using `llama.cpp` backends and GGUF quantized models. All tests load each model once and run a uniform set of deterministic evaluations.

This project is designed to model real constraints encountered when deploying LLMs onto low-cost VMs, edge servers, automation systems, and offline inference environments.

## Benchmark Methodology

Each model undergoes four independent analyses:

### 1. Coding Accuracy Benchmark

The test suite includes deterministic coding tasks:

* function definition correctness
* JSON generation
* bash commands
* fixing syntactic errors

Evaluation logic uses exact-match or strict pattern-match scoring.
Temperature is set to `0.0` to force deterministic, reproducible decoding.

**Metric:**
`Coding Accuracy (%)` = (correct coding outputs / coding tests) × 100

---

### 2. Reasoning and Math Benchmark

Tasks include:

* arithmetic
* logical induction
* classification by rule
* context-dependent inference

These tasks measure the model's internal consistency and symbolic manipulation capability.

**Metric:**
`Reasoning Accuracy (%)` = (correct reasoning outputs / reasoning tests) × 100

---

### 3. General Chat Benchmark

Simple factual and linguistic transformations:

* capital identification
* common scientific terms
* textual transformations
* general understanding

**Metric:**
`Chat Accuracy (%)` = (correct chat outputs / chat tests) × 100

---

### 4. Throughput (Tokens/Sec)

Measured using a fixed deterministic generation prompt on `n_threads=4`.
The target metric is the sustained output rate after warm-up.

**Metric:**
`Speed (t/s)` = tokens generated per second, reported by llama.cpp

---

### 5. Static RAM Footprint

Measured immediately after loading the model into memory:

`Static RAM = process_rss_after_load − process_rss_before_load`

This represents the cost of loading model weights.

---

### 6. KV-Cache Growth

A long-context test extends a session with sequential tokens.

**Metric:**
`KV Growth (MB)` = additional RAM consumption from generating 1000 tokens

Total RAM requirement for a 4096-token context is:

`Total_RAM(4k) = Static_RAM + (KV_Growth × 4 / 1024)`

This captures long-context cost.

---

## Final Outputs Collected

For each model, the benchmark suite reports:

* speed (tokens/sec)
* coding accuracy
* reasoning accuracy
* chat accuracy
* overall accuracy
* static RAM
* KV-cache growth
* total RAM required for 4k context

All results are consolidated into:

* sorted leaderboards per use-case
* complete raw tables of all metrics

### Key Engineering Insights

**1. Memory Bandwidth Constraints on 7B Architectures**
Benchmarks indicate that 7B parameter models (Llama 2, Mistral) are suboptimal for CPU-only edge deployment. Throughput consistently plateaued at ~3.6 tokens/second, a hard limit imposed by memory bandwidth saturation rather than CPU compute availability. Additionally, 4-bit quantization disproportionately impacted reasoning accuracy in these older architectures compared to modern 3B models.

**2. Qwen 2.5 as the Pareto-Optimal Solution**
Qwen 2.5 (3B) represents the most efficient balance of performance and resource usage. It fits within a 3.33 GB static memory footprint—leaving sufficient headroom on 4GB devices—while maintaining 80% reasoning accuracy. It is the only architecture evaluated that delivers reliable code generation and logic at real-time speeds without GPU acceleration.

**3. Quantization Sensitivity in DeepSeek R1**
While the DeepSeek R1 Distill (1.5B) model achieved the highest throughput (17 t/s) and lowest memory usage, it failed to meet the minimum accuracy threshold for complex tasks. The 1.5B parameter space proved highly sensitive to 4-bit quantization, degrading the logic centers required for multi-step reasoning. Consequently, this architecture is recommended strictly for low-complexity summarization rather than logic-dependent operations.
